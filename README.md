# React Learning Repository

This repository contains my learning journey with React.js. It includes various projects and examples covering fundamental React concepts and hooks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each dedicated to a specific React topic.

* **Props:** Demonstrates how to pass data from parent to child components using props.
* **conditional_randering:** Examples of conditionally rendering components based on different states or props.
* **formHandling:** Shows how to handle form inputs and manage form state in React.
* **handlingEvent:** Covers event handling in React, including synthetic events and event listeners.
* **hooks:** Contains examples of using various React hooks.
* **reactRouting:** Demonstrates client-side routing using React Router.
* **useCallback:** Explores the `useCallback` hook for memoizing functions.
* **useContextHook:** Shows how to use the `useContext` hook for managing global state.
* **useMemo:** Illustrates the `useMemo` hook for memoizing expensive computations.
* **useRef-Hook:** Examples of using the `useRef` hook for accessing DOM elements and persisting values.



## Topics Covered

This repository covers the following React topics:

* **Components and Props:** Building reusable UI components and passing data between them.
* **Conditional Rendering:** Dynamically rendering components based on conditions.
* **Form Handling:** Managing form inputs, state, and submissions.
* **Event Handling:** Responding to user interactions and events.
* **React Router:** Implementing client-side routing for single-page applications.
* **React Hooks:**
    * `useCallback`: Memoizing functions for performance optimization.
    * `useContext`: Managing global state across components.
    * `useMemo`: Memoizing expensive computations.
    * `useRef`: Accessing DOM elements and persisting values.
